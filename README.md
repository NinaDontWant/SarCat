# SarCat
The main website asks for submissions of private cat photos. These will be featured in weekly emails alongside random snarky or sarcastic quotes that are automatically found on the internet by a bot. Furthermore there will be an image gallery with previously sent quote/picture combos and a merch area that leads to Amazon.
